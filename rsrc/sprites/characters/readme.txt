Sprites produced by Maytch. Fan-art based on Kanako from Maria-Holic. 

Sprites are named by their sprite size and number of frames.

Free to use in your games, free to edit. Probably not for commercial use due to it being fan-art.

If you make something cool message me on twitter @Maytch as it'd be awesome to see.
